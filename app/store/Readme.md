# Stores

* Distance.js  
	This is a static store that is used to populate the drop down menu on the homepage that defines how far away from the user's location, the app should look for vendors.

* Education.js  
	This is a static store that is used to populate the Info view's list.

* Info.js  
	This is a dynamic store that loads data from a json. This was our first store and is used for testing purposes and thus we can change which json files we want to populate it.

* Location.js  
	This is a dynamic store that loads data from the newLocations.json. This store contains our first testing data after we updated the static store data to a json file and made the store load using a proxy.

* Product.js  
	This is a dynamic store that loads data from the newProducts.json. This store contains information fields that pertain to the products that exist in Oregon.

* Vendor.js  
	This is a dynamic store that loads data from the newVendors.json. This store contains information fields that pertain to the vendors that exist in Oregon.  

> (Note: That in our final project, the product and vendor stores will be populated with json data that we get back from API calls to our database.)
