# SeaGrant_Proto

A mockup of the Sea Grant android/iOS app structure.

We will be using an MVC framework and Sencha Touch, Phonegap, and the Google Maps API to create the "What's Fresh?" app for Sea Grant. This app will be used to find fresh seafood on the Oregon coast.   

For MVC app structure see the app folder, linting can be found in the syntax folder, testing is taken care of in the siesta folder, and the phonegap folder readme has more information on the splash screen setup. A more indepth explaination of the file structure is provided below.
